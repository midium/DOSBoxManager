# DOSBox Manager
DOSBox Manager is a .NET Frontend application able to manage your collection of old DOS Games and run them with a DOS Box installation on your PC.

This project is a rework of the AmpShell (http://ampshell.tuxfamily.org/) project from where I took some of the ideas behind the entire project.

Also used Custom Drawn Scrollbar from Code Project website (http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/41869/Custom-Drawn-Scrollbar) and slightly refactored to fit my needs.
